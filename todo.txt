stun vassals (disable them for next round) by inflicting certain damage? or playing certain cards?


convert fanfare to mp3

pawns buff up between rounds (increase HP by 5?)

what to do about your own pawns in the way? include 'pawn sacrafice' card in stock hand to kill own pawn?
    -- give enemy incentive to attack? discourage stalling strategies?
    -- in round 5 and after, if 3 rounds pass without any hits on either king; side with lowest hp king loses

timer for move (display countdown clock); auto pass if you let it expire? total time clock that forfeits if it expires?

communal cards? deck building?






give vassals high hp, but also a stun threshold that recharges every round; 
if stun meter zeroed at end of round, the vassal sits out next round


escalation:

    perhaps every round you can permanently mark an enemy square out of bounds, or curse the square (does dmg to occupant)
    (maybe even choose your own square, which could be useful if cursed squares block attacks)


card ideas:

    King Nuke: your own king does damage in 2 space radius to all units 
        (perhaps can choose to also use on enemy king such that enemy king damages all units in 2 space radius)
