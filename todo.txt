enforce king as first move





!!attacks are resolved at end of round; every unit attacks in all of their directions (hitting only enemies, not allies)



timer for move (display countdown clock); auto pass if you let it expire? total time clock that forfeits if it expires?


give vassals high hp, but also a stun threshold that recharges every round; 
if stun meter zeroed at end of round, the vassal sits out next round


escalation:

    perhaps every round you can permanently mark an enemy square out of bounds, or curse the square (does dmg to occupant)
    (maybe even choose your own square, which could be useful if cursed squares block attacks)
