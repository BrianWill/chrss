countdown timer in place of pass button

splash banner and sound on start of new round

if vassal dies, it is out permanently

win a king dies, game is over
    if both kings die in same round, game is draw



pawns buff up between rounds (increase HP by 5?)

what to do about your own pawns in the way? include 'pawn sacrafice' card in stock hand to kill own pawn?
    -- give enemy incentive to attack? discourage stalling strategies?
    -- in round 5 and after, if 3 rounds pass without any hits on either king; side with lowest hp king loses

timer for move (display countdown clock); auto pass if you let it expire? total time clock that forfeits if it expires?

communal cards? deck building?






give vassals high hp, but also a stun threshold that recharges every round; 
if stun meter zeroed at end of round, the vassal sits out next round


escalation:

    perhaps every round you can permanently mark an enemy square out of bounds, or curse the square (does dmg to occupant)
    (maybe even choose your own square, which could be useful if cursed squares block attacks)
