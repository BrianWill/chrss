splash banner and sound on start of new round

win a king dies, game is over
    if both kings die in same round, game is draw

if vassal dies, it is out permanently

when player has zero pawns, they get two at start of round instead of just one

set max pawns to 4 or 5 instead of 6?

what to do about your own pawns in the way? include 'pawn sacrafice' card in stock hand to kill own pawn?


timer for move (display countdown clock); auto pass if you let it expire? total time clock that forfeits if it expires?









give vassals high hp, but also a stun threshold that recharges every round; 
if stun meter zeroed at end of round, the vassal sits out next round


escalation:

    perhaps every round you can permanently mark an enemy square out of bounds, or curse the square (does dmg to occupant)
    (maybe even choose your own square, which could be useful if cursed squares block attacks)
