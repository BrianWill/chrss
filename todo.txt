at end of round (after combat), both players can (optionally) reclaim one or two units, which they can play in the next round

    [should playing units be done first before playing other cards?]



in deck builds, players choose a few high cost cards to start in their hand 
    (so player's can better plan around high impact end game cards)
    or perhaps card draw always gives players one card of their current max mana? or max mana minus 1 or 2?


perhaps vassals should be tankiest so using them as shields is not so discouraged

what if client sends timer_expired too early? keep sending until response?




protection against bad behaving clients (flooding with messages)
    rate limit, cut off client if it exceeds threshold



pawns buff up between rounds (increase HP by 5?)

what to do about your own pawns in the way? include 'pawn sacrafice' card in stock hand to kill own pawn?
    -- give enemy incentive to attack? discourage stalling strategies?
    -- in round 5 and after, if 3 rounds pass without any hits on either king; side with lowest hp king loses

total time clock that forfeits if it expires?

communal cards? deck building?






give vassals high hp, but also a stun threshold that recharges every round; 
if stun meter zeroed at end of round, the vassal sits out next round


escalation:

    perhaps every round you can permanently mark an enemy square out of bounds, or curse the square (does dmg to occupant)
    (maybe even choose your own square, which could be useful if cursed squares block attacks)


    pawns should have more hp, do a bit more damage? pawns should be harder to kill (otherwise 
    the board has too little continuity from round to round)


    some cards might be too powerful if cast after vassal placement, some too powerful if cast before?

    player must pick cards they will play for that round at start of round, or after king placement 
        (and opponent sees the cards)
        -take turns picking the cards?


card ideas:

    cards with variable 

    King Nuke: your own king does half damage to all units in 2 space radius

        (perhaps can choose to also use on enemy king such that enemy king damages all units in 2 space radius)


    heal

    stun vassal - make vassal sit out next round, only works if vassal takes damage at end of this round

    toggle pawn - move an allied or enemy pawn from first row to second or second to first 
        (cannot be cast on pawn that is blocked)

    wrapped targeting - a piece modified such that attacks wrap around board like pacman 
        (but also becomes vulnerable to wrapped attacks?)

    poison square - in next round, a square will damage occupied unit (lasts multiple rounds?)

    poison row - in next round, all squares in a row will damage occupied unit

    transparency - cast on enemy unit: this round, all rook and bishop attacks will penetrate 
        one square beyond this unit


    block square/row - temporarily or permanently block square from occupation (does it block attacks or do theyy go through?)


    castle - swap position of king and rook (can be cast on enemy?)


    reclaim vassal  - move vassal from the board back into your hand

    reclaim pawn - remove pawn from the board (if a mutated pawn, puts card back into your hand?)

    secondary bishop, rook, knight cards   (cost mana and only last for the round? or persist?)

    shift pawn - move pawn (ally or enemy) to random other column without a pawn

    armour - apply to unit to protect it this round from damage

    block pawn spawn in column - prevents auto spawn of pawn in column for next two rounds

    poison unit - takes damage every 

    amplify - cast on enemy - doubles all damage taken this round

    mana supress - decrease enemies mana pool by N (permanently? just this round? a few rounds?)

    force combat - ends the round, skipping to combat

    resurect - resurect a dead vassal (full health / half health?) [probably a high cost card]

    invade - open the enemy's front row for placing your pieces in this round

    attack buff - temp or permanent increase a piece's attack
    hp buff - temp or permanent increase a piece's hp (potentially above their starting max)


cards that can only be cast on enemies in line of attack
    - in some cases, require line of attack from specific vassal, e.g. can only cast on enemy threatened by bishop

cards that can be cast on an enemy but doesn't take effect unless it takes damage at end of round
