server sends valid moves



confirm / cancel buttons


no pass, but if player has no valid moves (because of cooldowns, lack of cards, then it auto-passes?
or maybe king has 1 turn cooldown and so can always move king


when playing white, flip board pieces and invert board clicks; also flip scoreboard




!!attacks are resolved at end of round; every unit attacks in all of their directions (hitting only enemies, not allies)

when your turn and no card selected, display pass button

timer for move (display countdown clock); auto pass if you let it expire? total time clock that forfeits if it expires?


give vassals high hp, but also a stun threshold that recharges every round; 
if stun meter zeroed at end of round, the vassal sits out next round
