messages explaining why a card is unselectable (e.g. resurect vassal can't be played because no vassal is dead)



stun vassal - for 1 round, targeted vassal (friend or foe) is Distracted, Unreclaimable, and DamageImmune

transparency - cast on enemy or allied unit: this round, all attacks will penetrate 
        one square beyond this unit (hitting the enemy unit as well?)






AI? random valid moves (can work in simple heuristics for some cards; wouldn't think 
    ahead, but at least can make OK choices in the moment)





communal cards? deck building?
in deck builds, players choose a few high cost cards to start in their hand 
    (so player's can better plan around high impact end game cards)
    or perhaps card draw always gives players one card of their current max mana? or max mana minus 1 or 2?

perhaps vassals should be tankier so using them as shields is not so discouraged

maybe pawns should do more damage? or do bonus damage to non-pawns? or take half damage (or 0) from pawns?
    pawns should be bigger deterent for placing pieces; too low damage makes it too easy to just eat the damage


protection against bad behaving clients (flooding with messages)
    rate limit, cut off client if it exceeds threshold



pawns buff up between rounds (increase HP by 5?)





total time clock that forfeits if it expires?









escalation:

    perhaps every round you can permanently mark an enemy square out of bounds, or curse the square (does dmg to occupant)
    (maybe even choose your own square, which could be useful if cursed squares block attacks)


  


    some cards might be too powerful if cast after vassal placement, some too powerful if cast before?

    player must pick cards they will play for that round at start of round, or after king placement 
        (and opponent sees the cards)
        -take turns picking the cards?


card ideas:



    wrapped targeting - a piece modified such that attacks wrap around board like pacman 
        (but also becomes vulnerable to wrapped attacks?)

    poison square - in next round, a square will damage occupied unit (effect lasts multiple rounds?)

    poison row - in next round, all squares in a row will damage occupied unit




    block square/row - temporarily or permanently block square from occupation (does it block attacks or do theyy go through?)    

    secondary bishop, rook, knight cards   (cost mana and only last for the round? or persist?)

    shift pawn - move pawn (ally or enemy) to random other column without a pawn

    armour - apply to unit to protect it this round from damage

    block pawn spawn in column - prevents auto spawn of pawn in column for next two rounds

    poison unit - takes damage every 



    

    invade - open the enemy's front row for placing your pieces in this round

    attack buff - temp or permanent increase a piece's attack
    hp buff - temp or permanent increase a piece's hp (potentially above their starting max)

    draw cards - draw two cards

    heal all pawns - restoration applied after combat?

    ricochet - select your vassal - attack on target is transmitted from teh target in same pattern, e.g. bishop hits   enemy and so bishop's diagonal attack emanates in all 4 diagonals from that enemy

    nullify - selected unit remains on board but takes no damage and inflicts no damage this round

    aoe - curse unit for 1 turn: damage applied to unit hits all neighbor spaces (for half?) 

    long pawn - restore pawn to max health and extend its attack range to two spaces 

    

    chain attack - buff on ally or curse on enemy? attack on unit spreads recursively through all cardinally            contiguous pieces (maybe transmits through diagonals too?)

    swap rows - swap ally/enemy back row with middle row

    disable column - prevent placement in column for this round? affects whole column black and white






    lock cards - lock 2 random, non-vassal cards in the enemy's hand for two rounds

    body double - plant a king with 50% change to swap places with real king (opponent can't see which is real); false king lasts only for the round; false king does no damage

    shitty bishop - a smaller, weaker bishop that has range of 3 and half attack/hp

    long knight - a smaller, weaker knight that has range of 3 instead of 2 and half attack/hp

    shitty rook - a smaller, weaker rook that has range of 3 and half attack/hp

    

    fog of war - mist covers a row, making all attacks on and from that row have a 50% chance of missing

    

    Place Pawn - place a pawn in any free square on your side (get to choose precise square); cannot be played if you already have 5 pawns    
        counts towards your max pawn limit


    mimic bishop - knight or rook adopts bishop attack pattern for this and next 2 rounds

    force reclaim - reclaim the piece you played in last turn, or force enemy to reclaim the piece they played in     
        last turn; the reclaimed piece cannot be used again this round

    hp aura - after combat, all adjacent pieces (including enemies?)
    attack aura - buff attack " " " " "

    time bomb - convert an allied pawn into a bomb: the bomb has 20hp and no attack, after 3 rounds, it   
        detonates, hitting everything adjacent for big damage (the bomb counts as a pawn for spawning purposes)


cards that can only be cast on enemies in line of attack
    - in some cases, require line of attack from specific vassal, e.g. can only cast on enemy threatened by bishop

cards that can be cast on an enemy but doesn't take effect unless it takes damage at end of round







on some browsers, scrollbar for card list and log not showing up when overflow-y

for scaling across dynos, use redis to share match state? ideally we can get both players of a 
    match to connect on same dyno, but not sure there's any mechanism for this

heroku: .play() is triggering exceptions? is it failing to play?
