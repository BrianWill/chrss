            <h1>How to play Chrss</h1>
            <p>(pronounced like CHUR-SS, but with your jaw kept shut)</p>
            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>Win by killing the enemy King or by killing two of the three enemy vassals (Bishop, Knight, and Rook). </p>
            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <p>In each round, the players first place their kings, then take turns playing four cards. 
            At the end of the round, combat is resolved, and the kings and vassals are reclaimed off the board back 
            into the players' hands. The full sequence is as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><h3>Spawn pawns <span class="automatic">(automatic)</span></h3>
                    <p>In the first round, each player is given four pawns, which are automatically and randomly placed on the board. In subsequent rounds, the player is given one additional pawn (or two if they have zero on the board) up to a max of five on the board. Pawns will not be placed in the back row nor placed in a column where any piece occupies either the front or middle row. (A new pawn is discarded if it has no valid space for placement.)</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Draw cards <span class="automatic">(automatic)</span></h3>
                    <p>A new hand is dealt every round. A hand consists of three vassal cards 
                    (Bishop, Knight, and Rook), three soldier cards, 
                    and three command cards. In later rounds, the players 
                    draw higher rank soldier and command cards.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Place Kings</h3>
                    <p>Before playing cards, both players must place their Kings on the board. Like all pieces, 
                    the King can only be placed on the player's side of the board.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Play cards</h3>
                    <p>Once both Kings are on the board, the players take turns playing cards. Each player must play 
                    two vassal cards, one soldier card, and one command card (in no particular order). 
                    In odd-numbered rounds, White has first turn. 
                    In even-numbered rounds, Black has first turn.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Combat <span class="automatic">(automatic)</span></h3>
                    <p>Once card playing ends, the pieces on the board damage each other according to their 
                    attack power and lines of attack (<em>e.g.</em> diagonal for bishops, cardinal directions 
                    for rooks, <em>etc.</em>). A single piece can damage multiple other targets, 
                    <em>e.g.</em> a bishop damages enemy pieces in all diagonal directions. Excepting certain 
                    status effects, attacks do not pass through allied or enemy pieces.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Reclaim pieces <span class="automatic">(automatic)</span></h3>
                    <p>After combat resolution, the Kings and vassals of both players are reclaimed off the 
                    board into the players' hands. A reclaimed Rook is healed for 5 HP.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p></p>

            <h3>Timeouts</h3>
            When the player fails to make a move before their timer expires, a random move is made for them.
